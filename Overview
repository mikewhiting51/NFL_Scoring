## Initial Questions
1. Has scoring increased over time, and if so, by how much? 
2. If scoring has increased, in what ways? Are teams simply scoring more offensive touchdowns, or have there been significant increases in other methods of scoring (two-point conversions, field goals, special teams/defensive touchdowns)? 
3. Has offensive innovation outpaced defensive innovation, evidenced by significant increases in yards per game over time? 
4. What impact have trends in other aspects of the game (penalties, turnovers, play count) had on scoring?
