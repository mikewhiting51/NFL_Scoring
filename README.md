This project looks at NFL scoring and yardage data over time in an effort to better understand (a) whether scoring has increased over time and (b) if so, what aspects of the game have driven this change. 
The project was done in R, and includes an R source file as well as a Google Slides deck with visuals and conclusions from the analysis.
